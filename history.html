      <p1 class="flow-text">
        In my first year of high school, I was offered to take up 1 instrument. I ended up with the alto saxophone, despite having put double bass as my first choice, but I now understand that I wouldn't have ended up playing it, I would have been crushed.<br>
        I had join many bands, in my early years, including the Senior Wind Band, conducted by Mr Carlo Madden. He Then passed my name to the conductor of the Edinburgh Schools Jazz Orchestra. It was here where I was discovered as a great jazz saxophonist.

      <p1 class="flow-text">
       It was my saxophone teacher who got me into jazz originally. This happened about 4 years of strict Classical playing, so was a little shock yet a great suprise as I had always had an intrest in jazz.<br>
       ESJO was the gateway to what would become a great part of my life. I had a great oppertunity to meet great saxophonists, such as Tommy Smith and Tony. The conductor, Dan Hallam, taught me pretty much everything I know in terms of energy, timing and various other things that I had to relearn in a sense.

      <h4>Aberdeen University Saxophone Ensemble<a id="edudate">2017 - Present</a></h4><br>
      <p1 class="flow-text">
        I started studying BSc Digital Media at Robert Gordon University in September 2017. As music was such a great part of my life, I didn't want to let it go, so searched for more ensembles in Aberdeen. This is when I sent e-mails to all of the people I know in Aberdeen.<br>
        The Aberdeen University Concert Band has allowed me to continue learning and keep up my musical mind-set.
